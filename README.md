# Key Highlights
The Problem: The department lacked a centralized way to track event details and booking capacity, leading to fragmented data and manual coordination.

The Solution: I built an automated Decision Support System (DSS) that consolidates all event-level data and booking statuses into a single operational calendar.

The Result: Eliminated manual tracking and provided a "single source of truth" for scheduling 50+ monthly events and managing buyer reservations.
